;Part 3 - Circumference of a circle of radius 4

  JMP multiply
  
  ; Variables
  radius: 4
  decrement: 1
  counter: 6  ;for every circumference calculation, the radius is multiplied to 2 and pi(3)
  ans: 0
 
  multiply: 
     LDAC radius    ; load radius in acc
     MOVAC       	  ; store radius into R
     LDAC ans 		  ;load value of addition in ACC
     ADD            ;add radius and addition
     STAC ans       ; store it into addition
     LDAC decrement       ; load 1
     MOVAC          ; mov 1 to R
     LDAC counter     ; Load the counter into Accumulator
     SUB            ; subtract 1 from counter value
     STAC counter   ; store new counter value into counter
  LDAC counter   ; load into acc for checking condition for jumpz
     JMPZ end       ;check if acc is empty, if its empty go to end
     JMP multiply   ; if acc is not empty jump back to loop
  end:
     LDAC ans  ;load the answer to acc
     OUT       ; output the answer
     ;answer 18
      HALT      ; Stop execution
